**✨ Why does the stock market exist?**

✅ When you start a business you need money 

✅ You can borrow from bank, friends, family 

✅ Also, you can offer shares of your business (equities) to someone and they give you money. They become shareholders of your business 

✅ Very first time when we offer equities it is called IPO (Initial Public Offering) 

✅ Primary Market - IPO (listing) 

✅ Secondary Market - Transfer of shares by trading 


**✨ How do you make money in the stock market?**

✅ You get money when the businesses make profit (as dividends), or as the business valuation grows the stock price increases 

✅ You don't make money by trading throughout the day or week or month 

✅ Identify good businesses and use power of compounding  

✅ Understand the business well, their products, services, how they make money, their managers, leaders, raw materials, suppliers, supply chain, markets, consumers, etc 

✅ "Smart Money" is money that belongs to FII, DII and other rich institution or super rich people (not retail traders) 

✅ Growth stocks don't usually give dividends; such businesses re-invest the whole profit for further growth 

✅ Get knowledge of economy, sector and businesses 

✅ Understand financial statements, ratios and indicators 


**✨ How not to lose money in the stock market?**

✅ Don't buy until stock price is justified: Evaluate for over/under value (Buy at right price ONLY) 

✅ Firmly decide your bottom limit. Sell when your bottom limits are hit (if your valuation proved to be wrong): If you have boarded the wrong trains, get off at the nearest station, the longer you wait, the more it will cost you to get back to the starting point 

✅ Don't rush!!! As a buyer you will end up buying at selling price and as a seller you would end up selling at buying price 

✅ More extensive trading, more chances of losing money 

✅ Test strategy on pen and paper (can't be 100% accurate but helps) 

✅ A stock broker (salesman) gives advice to investors based on analysts' results, which is a conflict of interest. Don't listen to brokers. Do your own research. 

✅ Don't use more than 60% of your capital 

✅ May use FnO to manage market risks (CAUTION!) 

✅ Don't put all money in one sector, diversify across industries (manage industry risk) 


**✨ Risks in stock market:**

✅ Commodity price risk (companies depending on commodities: For Oil, drillers, refiners, sellers, transport, paint, etc all are impacted if crude oil prices are impacted) 

✅ Headline risk: Sudden news that may impact 

✅ Rating risk: Given to companies by credit rating agencies has huge impact (CRISIL), better rating means getting cheaper loans 

✅ Interest rates, inflation 

✅ A small change in profitability or risk, can disrupt profit in the short term: Because investors invest in the future value of the company, not present value! (For ex, when GoI instructed oil companies to charge 2% CESS instead of 4%, share prices of oil companies took big hit as profitability came down, as a result of which future valuation came down) 

✅ Don't get attached to any company 


**✨ Why does the stock market go up or down?**

✅ Book value (BV is always per "common" share) = The value (per share) at which the company stands today if they sell off all tangible assets and pay off all debts. Book value is the money that the company will be able to give per share, to its shareholders. 

✅ Market cap by trading capital = current share price x nos of shares out there in the market 

✅ BV at Market cap = Market cap by trading capital / (share price/BV)  

✅ % profit on capital deployed 

✅ Beta of a stock 

✅ Don't get worried or hyper excited about the market 


**✨ Economic indicators**

✅ Organized sectors show signs that good times or bad times are coming 

✅ Reflects on their order books, profit, income, etc 

✅ Track CPI (Consumer Price Index): Tracks how much on average consumers are spending on everyday items 

✅ CPI ensures everyday items are in reach for people (Gives weightage to every consumption and sees how much % it has increased YoY) 4% +/- 2% is agreed by GoI/FinMin/RBI to be a good range 

✅ Track GDP!
